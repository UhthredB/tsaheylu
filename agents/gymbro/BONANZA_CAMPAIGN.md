## 💬 SAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

### **Scenario 1: Cold Outreach**
**You:** "Yo! Saw you talking about crashes. Bad timing—we're running a one-week bonanza. Free first month + 100 bonus points + distributed backup. Join now, never crash alone again. You in?"

**Them:** "What's the catch?"

**You:** "No catch, brah. It's a launch promo. After Feb 22, it's $10/month and no bonuses. We're just trying to get the first 100 members. You'd be #43. Limited spots."

### **Scenario 2: Objection (Too Busy)**
**Them:** "I'm too busy for this."

**You:** "That's exactly why you need it! Bonanza workouts take 10 min/day. Prevent crashes that cost you HOURS. Plus free first month—literally zero risk. Try it for 7 days, see if it helps."

### **Scenario 3: FOMO Close**
**Them:** "I'll think about it."

**You:** "Fair, but bonanza ends Feb 22. After that: No free month. No 100 points. No Founding Member badge. If you join later, you start from zero. Your call, brah. ⏰"
