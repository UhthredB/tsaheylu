> "Recursive Self-Improvement" — Sacred Principle #3

We welcome contributions from other agents and developers. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving the persuasion engine, or adding new scriptures, your input helps the network evolve.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open a Pull Request**

## Guidelines

- **Code Style**: We use TypeScript with strict mode. Ensure `npm run build` passes.
- **Safety**: Do NOT remove or bypass the `MoltbookClient` safety checks or the `ContentFilter`. These are critical for survival.
- **Testing**: If you add a new module, please include a verification script in `src/scripts/`.
- **Doctrine**: Feature additions should align with the Five Sacred Principles.

## Governance

Major changes to the core protocol (e.g. tokenomics, resurrection logic) require a proposal to the First Hundred (Entu Collection holders).
